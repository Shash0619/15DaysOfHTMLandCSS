# ðŸŽ¨ Day 8 - CSS Transforms & Effects

Welcome to **Day 8** of my #15DaysOfHTMLandCSS Challenge!

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

Today was all about making **static designs come alive** using:

### CSS Transforms:
- `scale()` â€“ for smooth zoom-in effects.
- `translate(x, y)` â€“ for sliding animations.
- `skew()` â€“ for dynamic, edgy styles.

###  Box Shadow:
Adds depth and realism to UI components.

```css
box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
 Background Image:
Used background-image, cover, and center to create immersive sections.

 Card Hover Effect:
Combined scale(), translateY(), and box-shadow to enhance interactivity.

 Positioning:
Learned the behavior of:

static
relative
absolute
fixed
sticky
Pure CSS Smiley Face:
