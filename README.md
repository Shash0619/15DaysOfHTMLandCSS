# 🧑‍💻 Day 9 - Flexbox & Grid: Mastering Modern Layouts

Welcome to **Day 9** of my #15DaysOfHTMLandCSS Challenge!  
Today I explored **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** — the two powerhouse layout systems for modern web design.

---

## 🔍 What I Learned

### 📦 Flexbox (1D Layout)
- `display: flex` — activates flexbox
- `flex-direction` — controls direction (row, column)
- `justify-content` — aligns items horizontally
- `align-items`, `align-content` — vertical alignment
- `flex-wrap` — handles wrapping of child elements
- `flex` — shorthand for grow/shrink/basis

Perfect for:
- Navbars
- Centering elements
- Aligning cards and buttons

---

### 🧩 CSS Grid (2D Layout)
- `display: grid` — activates grid layout
- `grid-template-columns/rows` — define structure
- `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap` — spacing
- `grid-column`, `grid-row` — span/position items

Ideal for:
- Page layouts
- Photo galleries
- Dashboards

---

## 💻 Demo Includes

- A **Flexbox section** with 4 responsive items
- A **CSS Grid section** with a 3-column layout and responsive breakpoints
- Mobile-responsive design with media queries

## 💡 Realization

> **Flexbox** is like a smart horizontal/vertical packer — fast and intuitive.  
> **Grid** gives total blueprint control — great for entire sections and layouts.  
Together, they solve 90%+ of layout challenges in web design.

## 📌 What's Next?
