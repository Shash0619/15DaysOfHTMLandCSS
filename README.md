# 🧑‍💻 Day 2: Laying the Structural Foundation

Welcome to **Day 2** of my self-paced **#15DaysOfHTMLandCSS** Challenge!

Today’s focus was all about laying down the **structural building blocks** of a webpage using **HTML semantics and layout techniques**. Here's a summary of everything I explored today.

---

## 🔍 What I Learned

### ✅ HTML Structure & Semantics:
- **Inline vs Block Elements**  
  Understanding how elements behave and occupy space on a page.

- **`<div>` vs `<span>`**  
  - `div`: A block-level container
  - `span`: An inline-level container  
  Useful for organizing and styling content efficiently.

- **Semantic Tags**
  Using meaningful HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO:  
  - `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`

- **`<hr>` Tag**
  - Used to insert **thematic breaks** between content sections.

- **`<sub>` and `<sup>` Tags**
  - For scientific notation and mathematical expressions.  
    Example: `H<sub>2</sub>O`, `E = mc<sup>2</sup>`

- **HTML Entities**
  Writing special characters like:
  - `&copy;` → ©
  - `&nbsp;` → Non-breaking space
  - `&lt;`, `&gt;` → Less than & greater than symbols

- **Emmet Shortcuts**  
  - `! + TAB` → Instantly generates HTML boilerplate.  
  Emmet is a **productivity powerhouse**! 🚀

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> Using **semantic HTML** not only makes code cleaner and more readable but also improves accessibility for screen readers and boosts SEO performance.  
> Emmet saves time and effort while writing HTML!

**Day 3:** I’ll dive into **HTML Forms**:  
- `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more!
