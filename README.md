#  Day 3: Tables & Forms in HTML

Welcome to Day 3 of my **#15DaysOfHTMLandCSS Challenge**!  
In this mini project, I explored the structure and purpose of HTML **tables** and **forms** ‚Äì two essential elements for organizing data and collecting user input on the web.

##  What‚Äôs Inside

This project includes:

-  A semantic HTML **table** showing contact details
  - Usage of `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`
  - Use of `colspan` and `rowspan` to merge cells
-  A fully functional **HTML form** for user feedback
  - Various `<input>` types: `text`, `email`, `radio`, `checkbox`, `range`
  - Elements like `<label>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`
  - Semantic structure for improved accessibility and usability
-  Simple CSS for layout and styling

##  Files

- `index.html` ‚Äì Main file containing the table and form
- `README.md` ‚Äì This file, describing the project

##  How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Or use **Live Server** extension in VS Code for real-time preview

##  Preview

*(Optional: Add a screenshot of your project and rename it to `preview.png`)*

##  What I Learned

- Tables are not just for layout ‚Äì they bring **structured clarity** to data.
- Forms are **powerful interfaces** for collecting user input.
- Each HTML tag has **semantic meaning** that improves accessibility and browser behavior.

##  Next Step

Moving on to **CSS Basics** in Day 4 ‚Äì styling elements, adding colors, and improving layout!
