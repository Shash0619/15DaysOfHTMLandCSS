#  Day 4: Introduction to CSS – #15DaysOfHTMLandCSS

Welcome to **Day 4** of my **#15DaysOfHTMLandCSS Challenge**!  
Today I explored the basics of **CSS** — the styling layer of the web that makes HTML come to life! 🎨✨

## 📘 What’s Inside

This mini project contains:

-  A basic HTML page styled using internal CSS
-  Demonstrations of:
  - CSS syntax (selectors + declarations)
  - Text styling (alignment, weight, spacing)
  - Color styling using HEX and named values
  - CSS units: px, %, em, rem
  - Fonts and typography

##  Key Learnings

- CSS helps control the layout, look, and feel of HTML documents.
- Styling can be applied via Inline, Internal, or External methods.
- Color, spacing, and typography greatly impact **readability** and **user experience**.
- CSS is not just visual — it's functional design!

##  What's Next?

Next up in the challenge:  
**Day 5: CSS Selectors & Combinators** — unlocking the true power of CSS targeting. Stay tuned!
