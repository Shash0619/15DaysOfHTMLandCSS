# 🧑‍💻 Day 13: Bootstrap Forms, Cards & Grids — Clean Layouts & Form UI

Part of my **#15DaysOfHTMLandCSS** challenge, this project focuses on building structured layouts and beautiful forms using Bootstrap 5 components and grid system.

## 🔍 What This Demo Includes

- ✅ Bootstrap Card component
- ✅ Grid layout with responsive columns
- ✅ Fully styled and responsive form
- ✅ Input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes
- ✅ Proper use of spacing, alignment, and Bootstrap utilities

## 📦 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5.3 (via CDN)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

> Forms don’t have to be complex. Bootstrap gives us clean, accessible, and mobile-ready form elements out of the box. Combine that with its grid system, and we’re able to build clear, responsive UI layouts in minutes.
