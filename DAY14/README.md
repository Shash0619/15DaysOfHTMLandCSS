# 🎧 Spotify UI Clone with Tailwind CSS

This is a mini project from **Day 14 of my #15DaysOfHTMLandCSS Challenge** where I built a Spotify-like music streaming interface using **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to practice real-world layout structures, sticky navigation, and responsive UI components.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive layout using Flex and Grid
- Sidebar navigation with playlist scrolling
- Sticky header for playback context
- Interactive album/playlist cards
- Fixed audio player with custom controls
- Styled range inputs for playback progress
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind CDN
